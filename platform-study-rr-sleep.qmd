## H1a: Late-night gaming is associated with poorer sleep quality.

Multilevel ordinal regression whereby monthly average minutes played predicts sleep quality (PSQI), controlling for age, BMI, SES index, region, and whether playtime falls on a weekend, with a random intercept and slope for participants.

```{r}
#| label: h1a
#| code-summary: "Fit H1a model"

# For psqi_6 1 means Very good, 2 means Fairly good, 3 means Fairly bad, 4 means Very bad

# Fit the model with rescaled covariates
model.h1a <- clmm(psqi_6_ord ~ monthly_avg_minutes_played + (1 + monthly_avg_minutes_played | pid) +
                    age_scaled + bmi_scaled + SES_index_scaled + region + isWeekend,
                  data = gamingMonthly)

modelsummary(
  list(`Model H1a` = model.h1a),
  fmt = 2,
  estimate  = "{estimate} [{conf.low}, {conf.high}]{stars}", 
  statistic = NULL
)
```


## H1b: Late-night gaming is associated with shorter sleep duration.

Multilevel linear regression whereby monthly average minutes played predicts total hours of sleep (PSQI), controlling for age, BMI, SES index, region, gender, and whether playtime falls on a weekend, with a random intercept and slope for participants and a random intercept for gender.

```{r}
#| label: h1b
#| code-summary: "Fit H1b model"

# Fit the model
model.h1b <- lmer(total_hours_sleep ~ monthly_avg_minutes_played + (1 + monthly_avg_minutes_played | pid) +
                    age_scaled + bmi_scaled + SES_index_scaled + (1 | gender) + region + isWeekend, 
                  data = gamingMonthly
                  )

# Summarize the model using modelsummary
modelsummary(
  list(`Model H1b` = model.h1b),
  fmt = 2,
  estimate  = "{estimate} [{conf.low}, {conf.high}]{stars}", 
  statistic = NULL
)
```

## H1c: Late-night gaming is associated with lower well-being.

Multilevel linear regression whereby monthly average minutes played predicts daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), controlling for age, BMI, SES index, region, gender, and whether playtime falls on a weekend, with a random intercept and slope for participants and a random intercept for gender.

```{r}
#| label: h1c
#| code-summary: "Fit H1c model"

model.h1c <- lmer(wemwbs ~ biweekly_avg_minutes_played + (1 + biweekly_avg_minutes_played | pid) +
                    age_scaled + bmi_scaled + SES_index_scaled + (1 | gender) + region + isWeekend, 
                  data = gamingBiweekly)

modelsummary(
  list(`Model H1c` = model.h1c),
  fmt = 2,
  estimate  = "{estimate} [{conf.low}, {conf.high}]{stars}", 
  statistic = NULL
)

```

## H1d: Late-night gaming is associated with higher daytime sleepiness.

Multilevel linear regression whereby biweekly average minutes played predicts well-being (WEMWBS), controlling for age, BMI, SES index, region, gender, and whether playtime falls on a weekend, with a random intercept and slope for participants and a random intercept for gender.

```{r}
#| label: h1d
#| code-summary: "Fit H1d model"

# Fit the model
model.h1d <- lmer(epsTotal ~ monthly_avg_minutes_played + (1 + monthly_avg_minutes_played | pid) +
                    age_scaled + bmi_scaled + SES_index_scaled + (1 | gender) + region + isWeekend, 
                  data = gamingMonthly)

# Summarize the model using modelsummary

  estimate  = "{estimate} [{conf.low}, {conf.high}]{stars}", 
  statistic = NULL

## H2

### H2a: The negative association between late-night gaming and sleep quality is more pronounced among evening chronotypes.

Multilevel ordinal regression whereby the interaction between monthly average minutes played and chronotype (MSFsc: mid-sleep on free days corrected for sleep debt on weekdays; MCTQ) predicts sleep quality (PSQI), controlling for age, BMI, SES index, region, and whether playtime falls on a weekend, with a random intercept and slope for participants.

On the simulation data, there are convergence problems, so here we center late night minutes and chronotype. This will either be uncentered for interpretation or not necessary on the true data.)

```{r}
#| label: h2a
#| code-summary: "Fit H2a model"

# Fit the model with rescaled covariates
model.h2a <- clmm(psqi_6_ord ~ scale(monthly_avg_minutes_played) * scale(msf_sc_numeric) + (1 + monthly_avg_minutes_played | pid) +
                    age_scaled + bmi_scaled + SES_index_scaled + region + isWeekend,
                  data = gamingMonthly)

modelsummary(
  list(`Model H2a` = model.h2a),
  fmt = 2,
  estimate  = "{estimate} [{conf.low}, {conf.high}]{stars}", 
  statistic = NULL
)
```

## H2b: The negative association between late-night gaming and sleep duration is more pronounced among evening chronotypes. 

```{r}
#| label: h2b
#| code-summary: "Fit H2b model"

# Fit the model
model.h2b <- lmer(total_hours_sleep ~ monthly_avg_minutes_played * msf_sc_numeric + (1 + monthly_avg_minutes_played | pid) +
                    age_scaled + bmi_scaled + SES_index_scaled + region + isWeekend + (1 | gender), 
                  data = gamingMonthly)

# Summarize the model using modelsummary
modelsummary(
  list(`Model H2b` = model.h2b),
  fmt = 2,
  estimate  = "{estimate} [{conf.low}, {conf.high}]{stars}", 
  statistic = NULL
)

```

### H2c: The negative association between late-night gaming and well-being is more pronounced among evening chronotypes.

Multilevel linear regression whereby the interaction between monthly average minutes played and chronotype (MSFsc; MCTQ) predicts daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), controlling for age, BMI, SES index, region, gender, and whether playtime falls on a weekend, with a random intercept and slope for participants and a random intercept for gender.

```{r}
#| label: h2c
#| code-summary: "Fit H2c model"

# Fit the model
model.h2c <- lmer(wemwbs ~ biweekly_avg_minutes_played * msf_sc_numeric + (1 | pid) +
                    age_scaled + bmi_scaled + SES_index_scaled + region + isWeekend + (1 | gender), 
                  data = gamingBiweekly)

```{r}
#| label: h2d
#| code-summary: "Fit H2d model"

model.h2d <- lmer(epsTotal ~ monthly_avg_minutes_played * msf_sc_numeric + (1 + monthly_avg_minutes_played | pid) +
                    age_scaled + bmi_scaled + SES_index_scaled + region + isWeekend + (1 | gender),

## Precision Analysis


In the above examples, we use the simulated data, which mirrors the structure of the true data, but lacks control over the distribution and relationships between the particular variables used in this study. To provide rough indications of the estimated precision of our tests, here we simulate a dataset with a known relationship between playtime and sleep, and then fit H1b as above (selecting one hypothesis for detailed inspection to illustrate).

We assume that late-night gaming is zero-inflated gamma distributed, where 30% of people will have no late-night play at all, and the remainder generally very little (0-30 minutes), with a handful of extreme values. We assume a true effect of 1-hour of late-night gaming reducing sleep duration by .2 hours, and that the effect varies by person, with a standard deviation of .2. We then fit the model as above, and examine the estimated effect size and confidence intervals.
