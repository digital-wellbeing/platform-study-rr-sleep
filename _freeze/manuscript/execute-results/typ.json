Late-night gaming has been shown to disrupt sleep patterns, reduce sleep duration, lower sleep quality, and increase daytime sleepiness [@exelmans2015sleep; @han2024electronic; @kristensen2021problematic]. This is especially concerning given the far-reaching effects of sleep disturbances on cognitive and emotional functioning [@cain2010electronic; @lebourgeois2017digital; @mccoy2011cognitive; @simon2020sleep; @vriend2013manipulating]. For instance, habitual gaming between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. has been associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms, partially mediated by daytime sleepiness [@lemola2011habitual]. Understanding the consequences of late-night gaming is thus vital for both gamers and health professionals.\n\n## Mechanisms Linking Late-Night Gaming to Sleep Disturbance\n\nTwo key mechanisms have been proposed to explain the impact of late-night digital engagement—including gaming—on sleep. The first is the **displacement hypothesis**, which argues that late-night gaming is more harmful than daytime gaming because it cuts into sleep time [@twenge2019more; @williams2008who]. Gamers often feel compelled to continue playing and struggle with self-regulation, which can lead to insufficient sleep [@king2009understanding; @pirrone2024why; @spada2017metacognitions]. For example, adolescents experiencing a heightened sense of \"flow\" during challenging games delayed bedtime by up to 90 minutes [@smith2017mechanisms].\n\nThe second mechanism involves **arousal-related disturbances** in sleep architecture caused by late-night gaming. Empirical studies have shown that extended gaming, especially when involving violent content, significantly decreases REM sleep and total sleep time [@king2013impact]. @weaver2010effect highlighted that increased arousal levels due to pre-sleep gaming extend sleep latency and alter the natural progression into sleep stages. This delay in sleep onset could be exacerbated by lower melatonin levels following an evening of gaming, compared to neutral activities like board games, which are crucial for regulating the sleep-wake cycle [@hartmann2019effects].\n\n## The Moderating Role of Chronotype\n\nNegative effects of late-night gaming are often compounded among individuals with an eveningness chronotype—a group naturally predisposed to staying up late. Problematic gamers, who frequently possess this chronotype, are especially vulnerable to the detrimental effects of late-night gaming on sleep [@kristensen2021problematic]. Pre-sleep technology use may exacerbate the misalignment between their biological clock and societal demands by delaying sleep onset and reducing sleep duration, leading to poorer sleep quality and increased daytime sleepiness.\n\nResearch has linked evening chronotype in adolescents to greater technology use at bedtime, in turn associated with delayed sleep onset, shorter sleep duration, and poorer sleep quality [@bruni2015technology; @gumport2021impact; @kortesoja2023latenight; @reardon2023adolescent]. Additionally, while @reardon2023adolescent found that shorter sleep on weekdays was associated with greater psychological distress, technology medium and chronotype were not direct predictors of distress. @gumport2021impact found that technology use improved emotional, social, cognitive, and physical health but worsened behavioral health, measured by the consumption of junk food, caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, and other substances, in evening-type adolescents. It remains unclear how strongly these findings apply to young adults and adults, as most research has focused on adolescent populations. This leaves an open question about the extent to which evening chronotypes in older age groups are similarly affected by pre-sleep technology use.\n\n## The Present Study\n\nIn sum, the literature indicates that video gaming, particularly when it occurs late at night, has significant implications for sleep quality, sleep duration, and overall wellbeing. This disruption can be attributed to both the displacement hypothesis [@twenge2019more; @williams2008who] and arousal-related disturbances in sleep architecture [@king2013impact]. Individual differences, such as chronotype, may moderate these effects, with eveningness chronotypes particularly vulnerable to the negative consequences of late-night gaming [@kristensen2021problematic]. The present study aims to empirically test the following hypotheses regarding the relationship between late-night gaming and sleep outcomes:\n\n**H1**: Late-night gaming is associated with:\n\n- **H1a**: Poorer sleep quality\n- **H1b**: Shorter sleep duration\n- **H1c**: Higher daytime sleepiness\n- **H1d**: Lower wellbeing\n\nIn addition to testing direct relationships between late-night gaming and various sleep-related outcomes are critical to understand, we further assess the potential moderating role of chronotype, which refers to a person's natural preference for activities during certain times of the day—morningness or eveningness. Individuals with an evening chronotype tend to stay up later and may be more inclined to engage in late-night gaming, potentially exacerbating the negative impacts on sleep and wellbeing. The combination of an evening chronotype and late-night gaming may even have a compounded effect on overall wellbeing, as both factors are independently associated with poorer mental health outcomes. Given this, we propose the following:\n\n**H2**: Chronotype moderates the relationships between late-night gaming and all outcomes in H1 (sleep quality, sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, and wellbeing), such that these negative associations are stronger for individuals with more of an eveningness chronotype.\n\nBy examining chronotype on a continuous scale as a moderating factor, this study seeks to provide a more nuanced understanding of the potential risks associated with late-night gaming and to identify individuals who may be most vulnerable to its negative effects.\n\n# Methods\n\n## Data Source and Measures\n\nThe analyses reported here are part of a Stage 1 Registered Report [@ballou2024psychological] and utilize data from the Open Play dataset [@ballou2025openplay], a longitudinal study that collected multi-platform video game digital trace data alongside psychological measures from adult gamers in the UK and US over a three-month period. The study combined objective behavioral telemetry from gaming platforms with repeated self-report surveys administered biweekly across six waves. Importantly, the present analyses use only a subset of the Open Play dataset, specifically data from Nintendo, Xbox, and Steam platforms, as these provide session-level (Nintendo, Xbox) or near session-level (Steam) temporal granularity necessary for hourly aggregation of playtime to operationalize late-night gaming (23:00–06:00). The following validated measures were administered via panel surveys at multiple timepoints: **Wellbeing** was assessed using the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale [SWEMWBS; @tennant2007warwick], a 7-item measure of mental wellbeing covering psychological functioning and subjective well-being over the past 2 weeks, with responses on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from \"None of the time\" to \"All of the time\" (score range: 7–35). **Chronotype** was measured at baseline (Wave 1) using the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire [MCTQ; @roenneberg2003life]. The key metric used in this study is MSF~sc~ (Mid-Sleep on Free Days corrected for sleep debt on work days), which represents an individual's natural sleep-wake preference when not constrained by social obligations. Higher MSF~sc~ values indicate a preference for eveningness (later sleep-wake times). **Sleep quality and duration** were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI; @buysse1989pittsburgh], a 19-item questionnaire evaluating sleep quality over the past month. The measure yields seven component scores (sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction) and a global score (range: 0–21), with scores above 5 indicating poor sleep quality. **Excessive daytime sleepiness** was measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS; @johns1991new], an 8-item scale assessing the likelihood of dozing off in various situations (score range: 0–24). Higher scores indicate greater propensity for daytime sleepiness, with scores above 10 typically indicating clinically significant excessive sleepiness.\n\n## Handling Missing Data\n\nMissingness in the longitudinal self-report outcomes (PSQI sleep duration, PSQI item 6, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and SWEMWBS) was addressed via multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE; `mice` v3.16.0 in R), using predictive mean matching (PMM) for all continuous/ordinal targets. We imputed data to preserve statistical power under a Missing at Random assumption conditional on rich auxiliary information. The imputation model included every analysis variable, static demographics (age, BMI, SES, region, gender recoded as male/female/other), chronotype (MSF~sc~), and dynamically derived gaming exposure summaries (overall and late-night minutes averaged over the preceding 14 and 28 days, plus an indicator for weekend surveys). To guarantee that each participant contributed a full six-wave panel to the imputation model, we first expanded the self-report data to the complete pid × wave grid and inferred survey timestamps for missing waves by aligning observed dates with wave-specific medians. Those inferred dates were then used to recompute the rolling gaming exposures so that auxiliary predictors remained non-missing even when a survey wave itself had no original timestamp. We generated 20 imputed datasets with 20 iterations each—sufficient to stabilize estimates given wave-specific missingness rates up to ~55%. Diagnostic trace, density, and strip plots confirmed well-mixed chains and plausible imputations. All regressions were fit separately in each imputed dataset and combined using Rubin’s rules.\n\nThe imputed outcomes serve as the primary analytic dataset throughout the main text. Complete-case (original) versions of every regression were re-estimated in parallel and included in the Supplement.\n\n# Results\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Data Quality Controls\n\nPrior to hypothesis testing, we conducted three positive data quality controls (DQCs) to validate expected patterns in the data. First, self-reported playtime was significantly correlated with digital trace playtime (r = 0.49, 95% CI [0.47, 0.51], p < .001), confirming convergent validity between subjective reports and objective telemetry. Second, social jetlag showed the expected positive association with daytime sleepiness (Spearman's ρ = 0.11, p < .001, one-sided), replicating established findings that circadian misalignment predicts sleepiness [@Fernandes2023jetlag; @Wu2025socialjetlag]. Third, sleep quality was negatively associated with wellbeing (Spearman's ρ = -0.51, p < .001, one-sided), consistent with the well-documented relationship between sleep and mental health [@Gadie2016how]. All three DQCs passed, providing confidence in the integrity of our measures before proceeding with hypothesis testing.\n\n<!-- Also include session integrity-related DQCs for Steam, Nintendo, and Xbox ensuring no overlapping sessions on Nintendo/Xbox (within each platform), and no impossible >60 minute intervals for Steam sessions. See Supplement for positive data quality control (DQC 2) details. -->\n\n\n## Participant Inclusion Criteria\n\nParticipants were included in the analytical sample if they passed a three-step filter: (1) completed at least one valid outcome measure (SWEMWBS, PSQI, or ESS) across any wave, (2) had valid timezone data (either self-reported or imputed for UK participants), and (3) contributed at least one valid gaming session during the study period. This filtering approach ensured that all included participants had the necessary data to test our hypotheses about late-night gaming and its effects on sleep and wellbeing outcomes.\n\n## Sample Demographics\n\nThe analytical sample includes all participants who met the inclusion criteria described above.

Self-reported sleep duration of 7.2 hours (SD = 1.1) falls within the typical range of 7.1–7.7 hours reported in systematic reviews of adult gamers [@kemp2021sleep; @derosa2024videogaming]. Mean daytime sleepiness (ESS = 5.6, SD = 3.5) was slightly elevated relative to general population norms (CIT), with the majority scoring below the clinical cut-off of 10. The mean PSQI global score of 6.7 (SD = 2.8) and 64% prevalence of poor sleepers is consistent with gamer samples (40–60%) and higher than general populations [@hinz2017sleep].\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Gaming patterns and outcome distributions.

The random slope variance was estimated at near-zero, and the gender random effect variance was also estimated at zero, indicating insufficient variation in both components. To address these computational issues, we simplified the random effects structure to a single random intercept for participants: `(1 | pid)`. Gender is retained as a fixed effect covariate. This change does not affect the fixed effects (the hypothesis tests) but provides more stable variance estimates.\n\nModel syntax: `psqi_6_ord ~ ln_monthly_avg_minutes_played + age_scaled + bmi_scaled + SES_index_scaled + gender + region + isWeekend + (1 | pid)`\n\n\n\n:::: {.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n\n::: {#tbl-h1-combined .cell tbl-cap='Summary of H1 Hypotheses: Effects of Late-Night Gaming on Sleep and Wellbeing'}\n#### H1 summary (Imputed data)\n\n```{=typst}\n#show figure: set block(breakable: true)\n\n#block[ // start block\n\n  #let style-dict = (\n    // tinytable style-dict after\n    \"0_1\": 0, \"1_1\": 0, \"2_1\": 0, \"3_1\": 0, \"4_1\": 0, \"5_1\": 0, \"6_1\": 0, \"7_1\": 0, \"8_1\": 0, \"9_1\": 0, \"10_1\": 0, \"11_1\": 0, \"12_1\": 0, \"0_2\": 0, \"1_2\": 0, \"2_2\": 0, \"3_2\": 0, \"4_2\": 0, \"5_2\": 0, \"6_2\": 0, \"7_2\": 0, \"8_2\": 0, \"9_2\": 0, \"10_2\": 0, \"11_2\": 0, \"12_2\": 0, \"0_3\": 0, \"1_3\": 0, \"2_3\": 0, \"3_3\": 0, \"4_3\": 0, \"5_3\": 0, \"6_3\": 0, \"7_3\": 0, \"8_3\": 0, \"9_3\": 0, \"10_3\": 0, \"11_3\": 0, \"12_3\": 0, \"0_4\": 0, \"1_4\": 0, \"2_4\": 0, \"3_4\": 0, \"4_4\": 0, \"5_4\": 0, \"6_4\": 0, \"7_4\": 0, \"8_4\": 0, \"9_4\": 0, \"10_4\": 0, \"11_4\": 0, \"12_4\": 0, \"0_0\": 1, \"1_0\": 1, \"2_0\": 1, \"3_0\": 1, \"4_0\": 1, \"5_0\": 1, \"6_0\": 1, \"7_0\": 1, \"8_0\": 1, \"9_0\": 1, \"10_0\": 1, \"11_0\": 1, \"12_0\": 1\n  )\n\n  #let style-array = ( \n    // tinytable cell style after\n    (align: center,),\n    (align: left,),\n  )\n\n  // Helper function to get cell style\n  #let get-style(x, y) = {\n    let key = str(y) + \"_\" + str(x)\n    if key in style-dict { style-array.at(style-dict.at(key)) } else { none }\n  }\n\n  // tinytable align-default-array before\n  #let align-default-array = ( left, left, left, left, left, ) // tinytable align-default-array here\n  #show table.cell: it => {\n    if style-array.len() == 0 { return it }\n    \n    let style = get-style(it.x, it.y)\n    if style == none { return it }\n    \n    let tmp = it\n    if (\"fontsize\" in style) { tmp = text(size: style.fontsize, tmp) }\n    if (\"color\" in style) { tmp = text(fill: style.color, tmp) }\n    if (\"indent\" in style) { tmp = pad(left: style.indent, tmp) }\n    if (\"underline\" in style) { tmp = underline(tmp) }\n    if (\"italic\" in style) { tmp = emph(tmp) }\n    if (\"bold\" in style) { tmp = strong(tmp) }\n    if (\"mono\" in style) { tmp = math.mono(tmp) }\n    if (\"strikeout\" in style) { tmp = strike(tmp) }\n    tmp\n  }\n\n  #align(center, [\n\n  #table( // tinytable table start\n    columns: (auto, auto, auto, auto, auto),\n    stroke: none,\n    rows: auto,\n    align: (x, y) => {\n      let style = get-style(x, y)\n      if style != none and \"align\" in style { style.align } else { left }\n    },\n    fill: (x, y) => {\n      let style = get-style(x, y)\n      if style != none and \"background\" in style { style.background }\n    },\n table.hline(y: 1, start: 0, end: 5, stroke: 0.05em + black),\n table.hline(y: 11, start: 0, end: 5, stroke: 0.05em + black),\n table.hline(y: 13, start: 0, end: 5, stroke: 0.1em + black),\n table.hline(y: 0, start: 0, end: 5, stroke: 0.1em + black),\n    // tinytable lines before\n\n    // tinytable header start\n    table.header(\n      repeat: true,\n[ ], [H1a: Sleep Quality], [H1b: Sleep Duration], [H1c: Wellbeing], [H1d: Daytime Sleepiness],\n    ),\n    // tinytable header end\n\n    // tinytable cell content after\n[Daily LN gaming (monthly)], [0.01 \\[0.01, 0.02\\]\\*\\*\\*], [\\-0.00 \\[\\-0.00, 0.00\\]], [], [0.00 \\[\\-0.00, 0.01\\]],\n[Daily LN gaming (biweekly)], [], [], [\\-0.00 \\[\\-0.01, 0.00\\]], [],\n[Age (scaled)], [0.44 \\[\\-0.23, 1.11\\]], [\\-0.45 \\[\\-0.62, \\-0.27\\]\\*\\*\\*], [0.08 \\[\\-0.57, 0.72\\]], [\\-0.79 \\[\\-1.35, \\-0.24\\]\\*\\*],\n[BMI (scaled)], [0.42 \\[0.13, 0.71\\]\\*\\*], [\\-0.09 \\[\\-0.17, \\-0.02\\]\\*], [\\-0.20 \\[\\-0.47, 0.08\\]], [0.23 \\[\\-0.01, 0.47\\]\\+],\n[SES (scaled)], [\\-0.46 \\[\\-0.74, \\-0.17\\]\\*\\*], [\\-0.10 \\[\\-0.18, \\-0.03\\]\\*\\*], [0.95 \\[0.68, 1.22\\]\\*\\*\\*], [0.15 \\[\\-0.09, 0.38\\]],\n[Region: US], [\\-0.44 \\[\\-0.95, 0.07\\]\\+], [0.06 \\[\\-0.07, 0.19\\]], [0.19 \\[\\-0.29, 0.67\\]], [0.24 \\[\\-0.18, 0.67\\]],\n[Day: Weekend], [0.32 \\[\\-0.03, 0.68\\]\\+], [0.03 \\[\\-0.05, 0.12\\]], [\\-0.22 \\[\\-0.47, 0.03\\]\\+], [0.13 \\[\\-0.17, 0.42\\]],\n[SD (Intercept | Participant)], [3.89], [0.96], [4.22], [3.12],\n[SD (Residual)], [], [0.65], [2.81], [2.16],\n[SD (Intercept | Gender)], [], [], [1.20], [0.52],\n[Num.Obs.], [2542], [2544], [5788], [2542],\n[ICC], [], [0.7], [0.7], [0.7],\n\n    // tinytable footer after\n\n    table.footer(\n      repeat: false,\n      // tinytable notes after\n    table.cell(align: left, colspan: 5, text([\\* p \\< 0.05, \\*\\* p \\< 0.01, \\*\\*\\* p \\< 0.001])),\n    table.cell(align: left, colspan: 5, text([LN \\= late\\-night.

The model produces coefficient estimates but standard errors and p-values cannot be reliably computed. This is a technical limitation of the ordinal modeling approach with complex interactions rather than a data quality issue. Adding gender as a random intercept causes complete convergence failure (optimizer nlminb fails), so only the participant random intercept is included.\n\nModel syntax: `psqi_6 ~
