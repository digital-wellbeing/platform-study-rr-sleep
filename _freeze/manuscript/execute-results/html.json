Late-night gaming has been shown to disrupt sleep patterns, reduce sleep duration, lower sleep quality, and increase daytime sleepiness [@exelmans2015sleep; @han2024electronic; @kristensen2021problematic]. This is especially concerning given the far-reaching effects of sleep disturbances on cognitive and emotional functioning [@cain2010electronic; @lebourgeois2017digital; @mccoy2011cognitive; @simon2020sleep; @vriend2013manipulating]. For instance, habitual gaming between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. has been associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms, partially mediated by daytime sleepiness [@lemola2011habitual]. Understanding the consequences of late-night gaming is thus vital for both gamers and health professionals.\n\n## Mechanisms Linking Late-Night Gaming to Sleep Disturbance\n\nTwo key mechanisms have been proposed to explain the impact of late-night digital engagement—including gaming—on sleep. The first is the **displacement hypothesis**, which argues that late-night gaming is more harmful than daytime gaming because it cuts into sleep time [@twenge2019more; @williams2008who]. Gamers often feel compelled to continue playing and struggle with self-regulation, which can lead to insufficient sleep [@king2009understanding; @pirrone2024why; @spada2017metacognitions]. For example, adolescents experiencing a heightened sense of \"flow\" during challenging games delayed bedtime by up to 90 minutes [@smith2017mechanisms].\n\nThe second mechanism involves **arousal-related disturbances** in sleep architecture caused by late-night gaming. Empirical studies have shown that extended gaming, especially when involving violent content, significantly decreases REM sleep and total sleep time [@king2013impact]. @weaver2010effect highlighted that increased arousal levels due to pre-sleep gaming extend sleep latency and alter the natural progression into sleep stages. This delay in sleep onset could be exacerbated by lower melatonin levels following an evening of gaming, compared to neutral activities like board games, which are crucial for regulating the sleep-wake cycle [@hartmann2019effects].\n\n## The Moderating Role of Chronotype\n\nNegative effects of late-night gaming are often compounded among individuals with an eveningness chronotype—a group naturally predisposed to staying up late. Problematic gamers, who frequently possess this chronotype, are especially vulnerable to the detrimental effects of late-night gaming on sleep [@kristensen2021problematic]. Pre-sleep technology use may exacerbate the misalignment between their biological clock and societal demands by delaying sleep onset and reducing sleep duration, leading to poorer sleep quality and increased daytime sleepiness.\n\nResearch has linked evening chronotype in adolescents to greater technology use at bedtime, in turn associated with delayed sleep onset, shorter sleep duration, and poorer sleep quality [@bruni2015technology; @gumport2021impact; @kortesoja2023latenight; @reardon2023adolescent]. Additionally, while @reardon2023adolescent found that shorter sleep on weekdays was associated with greater psychological distress, technology medium and chronotype were not direct predictors of distress. @gumport2021impact found that technology use improved emotional, social, cognitive, and physical health but worsened behavioral health, measured by the consumption of junk food, caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, and other substances, in evening-type adolescents. It remains unclear how strongly these findings apply to young adults and adults, as most research has focused on adolescent populations. This leaves an open question about the extent to which evening chronotypes in older age groups are similarly affected by pre-sleep technology use.\n\n## The Present Study\n\nIn sum, the literature indicates that video gaming, particularly when it occurs late at night, has significant implications for sleep quality, sleep duration, and overall wellbeing. This disruption can be attributed to both the displacement hypothesis [@twenge2019more; @williams2008who] and arousal-related disturbances in sleep architecture [@king2013impact]. Individual differences, such as chronotype, may moderate these effects, with eveningness chronotypes particularly vulnerable to the negative consequences of late-night gaming [@kristensen2021problematic]. The present study aims to empirically test the following hypotheses regarding the relationship between late-night gaming and sleep outcomes:\n\n**H1**: Late-night gaming is associated with:\n\n- **H1a**: Poorer sleep quality\n- **H1b**: Shorter sleep duration\n- **H1c**: Higher daytime sleepiness\n- **H1d**: Lower wellbeing\n\nIn addition to testing direct relationships between late-night gaming and various sleep-related outcomes are critical to understand, we further assess the potential moderating role of chronotype, which refers to a person's natural preference for activities during certain times of the day—morningness or eveningness. Individuals with an evening chronotype tend to stay up later and may be more inclined to engage in late-night gaming, potentially exacerbating the negative impacts on sleep and wellbeing. The combination of an evening chronotype and late-night gaming may even have a compounded effect on overall wellbeing, as both factors are independently associated with poorer mental health outcomes. Given this, we propose the following:\n\n**H2**: Chronotype moderates the relationships between late-night gaming and all outcomes in H1 (sleep quality, sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, and wellbeing), such that these negative associations are stronger for individuals with more of an eveningness chronotype.\n\nBy examining chronotype on a continuous scale as a moderating factor, this study seeks to provide a more nuanced understanding of the potential risks associated with late-night gaming and to identify individuals who may be most vulnerable to its negative effects.\n\n# Methods\n\n## Data Source and Measures\n\nThe analyses reported here are part of a Stage 1 Registered Report [@ballou2024psychological] and utilize data from the Open Play dataset [@ballou2025openplay], a longitudinal study that collected multi-platform video game digital trace data alongside psychological measures from adult gamers in the UK and US over a three-month period. The study combined objective behavioral telemetry from gaming platforms with repeated self-report surveys administered biweekly across six waves. Importantly, the present analyses use only a subset of the Open Play dataset, specifically data from Nintendo, Xbox, and Steam platforms, as these provide session-level (Nintendo, Xbox) or near session-level (Steam) temporal granularity necessary for hourly aggregation of playtime to operationalize late-night gaming (23:00–06:00). The following validated measures were administered via panel surveys at multiple timepoints: **Wellbeing** was assessed using the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale [SWEMWBS; @tennant2007warwick], a 7-item measure of mental wellbeing covering psychological functioning and subjective well-being over the past 2 weeks, with responses on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from \"None of the time\" to \"All of the time\" (score range: 7–35). **Chronotype** was measured at baseline (Wave 1) using the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire [MCTQ; @roenneberg2003life]. The key metric used in this study is MSF~sc~ (Mid-Sleep on Free Days corrected for sleep debt on work days), which represents an individual's natural sleep-wake preference when not constrained by social obligations. Higher MSF~sc~ values indicate a preference for eveningness (later sleep-wake times). **Sleep quality and duration** were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI; @buysse1989pittsburgh], a 19-item questionnaire evaluating sleep quality over the past month. The measure yields seven component scores (sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction) and a global score (range: 0–21), with scores above 5 indicating poor sleep quality. **Excessive daytime sleepiness** was measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS; @johns1991new], an 8-item scale assessing the likelihood of dozing off in various situations (score range: 0–24). Higher scores indicate greater propensity for daytime sleepiness, with scores above 10 typically indicating clinically significant excessive sleepiness.\n\n# Results\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Data Quality Controls\n\nPrior to hypothesis testing, we conducted three positive data quality controls (DQCs) to validate expected patterns in the data. First, self-reported playtime was significantly correlated with digital trace playtime (r = 0.49, 95% CI [0.47, 0.51], p < .001), confirming convergent validity between subjective reports and objective telemetry. Second, social jetlag showed the expected positive association with daytime sleepiness (Spearman's ρ = 0.10, p < .001, one-sided), replicating established findings that circadian misalignment predicts sleepiness [@wittmann2006social]. Third, sleep quality was negatively associated with wellbeing (Spearman's ρ = -0.51, p < .001, one-sided), consistent with the well-documented relationship between sleep and mental health [@baglioni2011sleep]. All three DQCs passed, providing confidence in the integrity of our measures before proceeding with hypothesis testing.\n\n## Sample Demographics\n\nThe analytical sample includes all participants who contributed at least one datapoint on at least one of the four outcome variables (sleep quality, sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, or wellbeing).

Self-reported sleep duration of 7.2 hours (SD = 1.1) falls within the typical range of 7.1–7.7 hours reported in systematic reviews of adult gamers [@kemp2021sleep; @derosa2024videogaming]. Mean daytime sleepiness (ESS = 5.6, SD = 3.5) was slightly elevated relative to general population norms (ESS ≈ 4.6, SD ≈ 2.8), with the majority scoring below the clinical cut-off of 10.

association between late-night gaming and sleep quality is more pronounced among evening chronotypes.\n\nMultilevel ordinal regression whereby the interaction between monthly average minutes played and chronotype (MSFsc: mid-sleep on free days corrected for sleep debt on weekdays; MCTQ) predicts sleep quality (PSQI component 6: subjective sleep quality), controlling for age, BMI, SES index, region, and whether playtime falls on a weekend, with a random intercept for participants.\n\n**Note on model convergence**: The cumulative link mixed model (`clmm`) with the interaction term encounters convergence issues (variance-covariance matrix not defined; model is nearly unidentifiable), which is a known limitation with ordinal mixed models containing interactions. The model produces coefficient estimates but standard errors and p-values cannot be reliably computed. This is a technical limitation of the ordinal modeling approach with complex interactions rather than a data quality issue. Adding gender as a random intercept causes complete convergence failure (optimizer nlminb fails), so only the participant random intercept is included.\n\nModel syntax: `psqi_6 ~ ln_monthly_avg_minutes_played * msf_sc_centered + age_scaled + bmi_scaled + SES_index_scaled + region + isWeekend + (1 | pid)`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## H2b: The negative association between late-night gaming and sleep duration is more pronounced among evening chronotypes.\n\nMultilevel linear regression whereby the interaction between monthly average minutes played and chronotype (MSFsc;

hours), sleep quality showed greater impairment, with 64% classified as poor sleepers. These patterns suggest that sleep quality and architecture may be more vulnerable to disruption than sleep duration in the context of regular gaming behavior.\n\n# References\n\n:::{#refs}\n:::\n\n```{=typst}\n#show: appendix.with()\n```\n# Appendix content here\n",
